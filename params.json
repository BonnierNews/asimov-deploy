Actual deploymentents are handled on each machine by the locally installed deploy agent.\r\n\r\n## Main Features\r\n* Cross platform web interface for distributed deployment (written in nodejs, and single page web UI with backbone.js)\r\n* Deploy windows services and IIS Web Applications or Sites\r\n* Automate load balancer and view load balancer status together with deploy units / machine status.\r\n\r\n## Windows deploy agent features\r\n* HTTP API\r\n* Talks to Deploy UI through HTTP\r\n* Deploy Windows Services\r\n* Deploy IIS Web Applications or Sites\r\n* Execute Powershell scripts included in deploy package\r\n* Automate load balancer (enable / disable machine in load balancer)\r\n    * Currently only supports Alteon, but support for more is on the way.\r\n* Execute phantomjs (& casper.js) verify & web site warmup scripts (and report progress & status to web UI)\r\n* Deploy logs & history\r\n* Package management\r\n   * Hard drive / fileshare zip files (version / branch / commit can be extracted from filename)\r\n   * Nuget support (not completed yet)\r\n* Automatic update of deploy agent\r\n* Automatic update of deploy agent config\r\n\r\n## Deploy UI Features\r\n* List deploy units from all agents that have reported in\r\n* User can select a version to deploy to a specific machine\r\n* Load balancer integration (optional feature)\r\n** Shows all machines and deploy units along with the load balancer status\r\n** Allows you to manually enable / disable machines in load balancer\r\n* View live agent logs where agents can report in what they are doing.\r\n* Execute verify step on each deploy unit / machine, what the verify step does is up to the agent and depends on the deploy unit type.\r\n\r\n# Roadmap\r\n* Documentation (Getting started Guide / Deploy Agent configuration guide)\r\n* Demo & Project site\r\n* Nuget package support\r\n* Improve security\r\n* Node.js deploy agent to enable deploy to unix machines\r\n* Add support for more load balancers\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
